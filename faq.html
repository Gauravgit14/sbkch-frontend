      <p>Unlike traditional tools, we show only what you need — in charts, words, and alerts you understand instantly. No clutter.</p>

      <p>Absolutely. All data is encrypted, and we never share or sell your information. You're in control.</p>

      <h2>📱 Can I access this on mobile?</h2>
      <p>Yes! Our platform is responsive and mobile-friendly.</p>

      <h2>📈 Do I need technical knowledge to use this?</h2>
      <p>Not at all. If you can use WhatsApp, you can use SBKCH. It’s designed to be that simple.</p>

      <h2>💬 Can I customize the dashboard?</h2>
      <p>Yes, you can choose chart types, time frames, and more. Your dashboard, your style.</p>
