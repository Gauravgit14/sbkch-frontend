      <p><strong>Project Gaurav</strong> is built with one simple belief —<br>
      <em>Analytics should be so easy, even a fruit seller can understand and act on it.</em></p>

      <p>We help businesses make smarter decisions using tools like Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Facebook Ads, and more — but we cut through the noise. No overwhelming dashboards, no technical complexity. Just the data that matters, presented in a way you choose to see it.</p>

      <h2>🧑‍💻 What We Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Log in securely with your account</li>
        <li>📊 View real-time insights in a simple dashboard</li>
        <li>📈 Choose how data is displayed — bar charts, line graphs, summaries</li>
        <li>🎯 Track user engagement, ad performance, peak hours, and more</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🤝 Why We’re Different</h2>
      <p>While others deliver raw numbers, we translate data into action — in simple words, easy visuals, and real-time insights.</p>
      <p>Your business is not just another client to us — we treat it like our own. Project Gaurav is not just another analytics tool.<br>It’s your business co-pilot — showing you when to act, where to focus, and how to grow.</p>
